# Web-Development

This README provides a brief overview of the web development project using Node.js.

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a web application using Node.js. The application consists of several files and folders which are outlined below:

- **pages**
  - `index.html`: This is the main landing page of the website.
  - `otherpage.html`: This is another page of the website.

- **node_modules**: This folder contains dependencies required for the project.
  - `mywebserver.sql`: Database file used by the web server.
  - `excelG00425678.csv`: CSV file containing data.
  - `excel2G00425678.csv`: Another CSV file containing data.

- `app.js`: This file contains the server-side JavaScript code responsible for running the web server.

- `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the project and manages project dependencies.

- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or the `package.json` file.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the web application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running:
